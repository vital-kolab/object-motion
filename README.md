No non-standard hardware is needed

Typical install time on Desktop computer for MATLAB 2022b: 

Installation times can vary based on several factors, including the speed of the computer's CPU, the type of storage device (HDD vs. SSD), the specific components and toolboxes being installed, and the speed of the internet connection if the installation is being performed online. In general, a typical MATLAB installation might take anywhere from 20 minutes to over an hour. For a more specific estimate, considering the factors mentioned would be crucial. Additionally, installing a minimal set of toolboxes will be quicker than opting for a full installation of all MATLAB toolboxes and products.
